Let us heed Jung's call to individuation, to shed the cocoon of conformity and emerge anew, like the phoenix from the ashes. \n            For as our Lord so wisely counseled, 'Clean the inside of the cup first' - let us first cleanse our hearts, our minds, and our wallets from the taint of 'woke' excess.
