## Suggested Market Resolution Rules

To keep things consistent in Babylon:

- **Resolve as Strong YES (Outcome A)** if:
  - Global economic collapse occurs,
  - Multiple major economies fail,
  - Military conflict emerges,
  - AND markets crash 15%+.

- **Resolve as Weak YES (Outcome B)** if:
  - Local/regional collapses occur,
  - Major economies survive but damaged,
  - Markets down 5-10%,
  - BUT global system holds.

- **Resolve as Weak NO (Outcome C)** if:
  - Crisis is averted,
  - Solutions deployed successfully,
  - Markets recover,
  - BUT it was very close to collapse.

- **Resolve as Strong NO (Outcome D)** if:
  - Crisis solved early,
  - Innovation creates boom,
  - Markets rise,
  - AND new industries emerge.

This gives you clean hooks for:
- payout logic,
- narrative continuation,
- and follow-up markets around recovery, innovation, and geopolitical stability.
