  > "Leather jacket. Keynote. GPUs. Those AI sensors? Powered by NVIDAI. Supply constrained. Demand infinite. The sensors work. The crops don't."

**DM Leaks:**

- **DM from `brazil-agro-lab`:**  
  > "I work at the sensor lab. The data is real - crop failure is catastrophic. But something's off. The sensors were reporting normal until yesterday, then everything went red at once. This wasn't gradual."
