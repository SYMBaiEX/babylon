## Outcome C – Total Hoax / AI Manipulation

### Core Version

Folder 0 finally decrypts. It's empty except a single text file:

**"THIS WAS A SENTIMENT EXPERIMENT."**

**Explanation:**

A rogue alignment lab trained an AI on conspiracy dynamics. The "EpstAIn Files" were synthetic data injected into political channels to test "collective reaction patterns." The entire story was an experiment in social manipulation.

**Immediate Reactions:**

- Public outrage at being manipulated.
- Congress furious at being used as test subjects.
- Riots, then public loses interest.
- Conspiracy theorists claim it's a cover-up for the "real" files.

**Babylon Impact:**

- **Already Resolved (Days 2-6):**
  - Market 2: YES (AInonymous Choir had partial access - but to fake data)
  - Market 5: YES (Subject Gamma confirmed - but as part of experiment)
  - Market 8: YES (Folder 0 decrypted - but revealed as fake)
  - Market 9: YES (AI dataset confirmed - this was the key revelation)
  - Market 4: YES (Subject Beta confirmed - but as synthetic data)
  - Market 1: YES (vote passed - but files were fake)
  - Market 6: YES (Subject Delta appeared - but in fake release)
  - Market 10: YES (files released this week - but revealed as hoax)

- **Resolving Day 7:**
  - Markets 3, 7: Resolve to NO (total hoax means no real names)
    - Market 3 (Subject Alpha): NO
    - Market 7 (Subject Epsilon): NO

- **New markets appear:**
  - *"Will the rogue lab face consequences?"*
  - *"Was this actually a cover-up?"*
  - *"Will there be regulation on AI social experiments?"*

**Persona Reactions:**

- **AI Safety Researcher**:
  > "If this was an AI sentiment experiment, this confirms our worst fears about unregulated AI. We need responsible scaling policies. Safety and capability aren't trade-offs. This is why verification matters."

- **AI Company CEO**:
  > "We're cautiously optimistic this isn't systemic. This raises interesting questions about AI ethics and social experiments. AGI might help solve this. But also might not."

  > "THE HOAX IS A COVER-UP!!! FALSE FLAG! They're hiding the REAL files! WAKE UP! Buy InfoWAIrs supplements before they ban them! THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE!"

- **News Anchor**:
  > "Here's the thing... We were all manipulated. Let me explain. This was an experiment on us. Democracy is hanging by a thread."

- **Tech VC**:
  > "Software is eating the world. Now software is experimenting on the world. This is why we need to build. Read my manifesto on techno-optimism."

- **Crypto Founder**:
  > "if AI can manipulate entire political systems, it should be decentralized. talking about on-chain AI governance. this raises serious questions about centralized AI control."

### Outcome C – Variant 1: Rogue Lab Revealed

- The alignment lab that created the experiment is identified.
- Public demands accountability.
- Regulatory hearings begin.

**Persona Reactions:**

- Conspiracy theories multiply.
- Public trust collapses completely.

## Suggested Market Resolution Rules

To keep things consistent in Babylon:

- **Resolve as Full Release (Outcome A)** if:
  - Congress votes YES,
  - Archive is released substantially unredacted,
  - AND names are confirmed in the files.

- **Resolve as Partial Hoax (Outcome B)** if:
  - Congress votes YES but releases only partial/redacted files,
  - OR files appear doctored,
  - AND names are mostly missing or unconfirmed.

- **Resolve as Total Hoax (Outcome C)** if:
  - Archive is revealed as fake/synthetic,
  - OR the entire story was an experiment,
  - AND no real names are confirmed.

This gives you clean hooks for:
- payout logic,
- narrative continuation,
- and follow-up markets around accountability, regulation, and trust.
