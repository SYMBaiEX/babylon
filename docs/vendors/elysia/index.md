### Introducing our most powerful feature yet

## TypeScript to OpenAPI

Elysia can generate OpenAPI specifications directly from your TypeScript code without any annotations, without any configuration and CLI running.

Allowing you to turn your actual code from any library like Prisma, Drizzle and every TypeScript library into your own API documentation.

typescript```
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'
import { openapi, fromTypes } from '@elysiajs/openapi'

export const app = new Elysia()
	.use(
		openapi({
			// ↓ Where magic happens
			references: fromTypes()
		})
	)
```

		body: t.Object({
			name: t.Literal('SaltyAom'),
			age: t.Number(),
			friends: t.Array(t.String())
		})
	})
```

ts```
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'
import { z } from 'zod'

new Elysia()
	// Try hover body  ↓
	.post('/user', ({ body }) => body, {
		body: z.object({
			name: z.literal('SaltyAom'),
			age: z.number(),
			friends: z.array(z.string())
		})
	})
```

ts```
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'
import * as v from 'valibot'

new Elysia()
	// Try hover body  ↓
	.post('/user', ({ body }) => body, {
		body: v.object({
			name: v.literal('SaltyAom'),
			age: v.number(),
			friends: v.array(v.string())
		})
	})
```

ts```
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

Incredible work.](https://x.com/shlomiatar/status/1822381556142362734)[htmx works great w/ @bunjavascript, @elysiaJS and @tursodatabase btw](https://x.com/htmx_org/status/1792949584769224897)[I’m a Node.js + Fastify diehard, but the Bun + Elysia combo looks very promising 👀](https://x.com/nuqs47ng/status/1991618158583771524)[Already using Elysia (+Bun) anywhere I can. Wouldn't want to back to node+express even if you'd pay me a mil.](https://x.com/Erwin_AI/status/1991740419110269107)[You can use Express with Bun, but often we see people using Elysia, Hono, or Bun.serve() directly.](https://x.com/jarredsumner/status/1781132294692233609)[Started using @elysiaJS to create a Discord Bot and found the type system beautifully easy. DX is fantastic and coding is fun! Use @DrizzleORM with PostgreSQL. So much easier than I've used before. ElysiaJS has proved to me that great performance and DX can live together. 😎](https://x.com/runyasak/status/1797618641648968117)[Was introduced to @elysiaJS today and it looks pretty solid. end-to-end type safety/guard/swapper are killer features of the modern web! (and it's fast)](https://x.com/hd_nvim/status/1735182378036027650)[so excited to be part of the amazing @elysiaJS community!](https://x.com/scalar/status/1744024831014920403)[handling tables with ~350k rows like it's nothing. Working on allowing @ag_grid server side row model when connecting a custom backend to @openbb_finance Terminal Pro.

I can't go back to express + node... Bun Hot reload an HTTP server and test runner is instantaneous!!! Elysia is a breath of fresh air + inferred types + openapi + plugins + file handling + ai sdk + typed client.... The dev experience is 100x - if you try you won't ever go back!!](https://x.com/meabed/status/1991531982933631247)[One diff ElysiaJS made in our org is that it makes it easy to refactor fearlessly. You can be pretty certain if things won't work simply because TypeScript will tell you that your types don't match](https://x.com/haxiom_io/status/1989357386398900670)[ElysiaJS was the first framework that truly sparked my interest in JS/TS. I used to avoid it entirely. I usually stick to Python, mostly using FastAPI. When I tried ElysiaJS for the first time (v1.1), I immediately felt it provides an amazing dev experience. Love ElysiaJS 😘](https://x.com/stacia__x/status/1990837540220465536)[I’m ngl we don’t talk about @elysiaJS enough](https://x.com/Rasmic/status/1964897923046703399)## Because of You

Thank you for making Elysia possible

#### Got more questions?

 Just Ask!  Ask Elysia (AI) Can I use Zod with Elysia?

Elysia validates incoming request data (params, query, body, headers, cookies, response) before your handler runs.

 It ships with a built‑in schema builder (Elysia.t) based on TypeBox, but it also natively supports any “Standard Schema” library – that includes Zod, Valibot, Yup, Joi, ArkType, Effect‑Schema, and many more.
