# Get transaction

> Get a transaction by transaction ID.

<Note>
  In August 2025 we migrated transactions to a new data store. As part of this migration, we changed
  the format of transaction IDs from CUID2 to UUIDv4. You may continue using the CUID2 for your
  existing transactions, but we encourage migration to the new UUID, as it will avoid a very slight
  latency increase due to an extra lookup for mapping from the legacy ID to the new ID.
