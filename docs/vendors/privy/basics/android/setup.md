## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [set up your Privy app and obtained your app ID](/basics/get-started/dashboard/create-new-app) and [client ID](/basics/get-started/dashboard/app-clients) from the Privy Dashboard.

<Warning>
  A properly set up app client is required for mobile apps and other non-web platforms to allow your
  app to interact with the Privy API. Please follow [this
  guide](/basics/get-started/dashboard/app-clients) to configure an app client.
</Warning>

## Initializing Privy

Initialize a **Privy** instance with your application context and a **`PrivyConfig`** object:

```kotlin  theme={"system"}
private val privy: Privy =
   Privy.init(
       context = applicationContext, // be sure to only pass in Application context
       config = PrivyConfig(
           appId = "YOUR_APP_ID",
           appClientId = "YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID",
           logLevel = PrivyLogLevel.VERBOSE
       )
   )
```

Initialization must occur on the main (UI) thread. Initializing from a background thread may cause unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

## Configuration

The configuration fields for the PrivyConfig are:

<ParamField body="appId" type="String" required>
  Your Privy application ID, which can be obtained from the [**Privy Developer
  Dashboard**](https://dashboard.privy.io), under App Settings > Basics
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="appClientId" type="String" required>
  Your app client ID, which can be obtained from the [**Privy Developer
  Dashboard**](https://dashboard.privy.io), under App Settings > Clients
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="logLevel" type="PrivyLogLevel" optional>
  (Optional) Your preferred log level. If no log level is specified, it will default to
  `PrivyLogLevel.NONE`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="customAuthConfig" type="LoginWithCustomAuthConfig" optional>
  (Optional) Only use this if you plan to use custom authentication. Find more information
  [here](/authentication/user-authentication/jwt-based-auth/overview).
</ParamField>

<Tip>
  Be sure to maintain a single instance of Privy across the lifetime of your application.
  Initializing multiple instances of Privy will result in unexpected errors.
</Tip>
