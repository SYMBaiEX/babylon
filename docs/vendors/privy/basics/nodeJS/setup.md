## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

* Get your [Privy app ID and app secret](/basics/get-started/dashboard/create-new-app) from the Privy Dashboard
* The following runtimes are supported:
  * Node.js 20 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.
  * Deno v1.28.0 or higher.
  * Bun 1.0 or later.
  * Cloudflare Workers.
  * Vercel Edge Runtime.
  * Nitro v2.6 or greater.

## Instantiating the `PrivyClient`

Import the **`PrivyClient`** class and create an instance of it by passing the Privy **app ID** and **app secret** as parameters.

```ts  theme={"system"}
import {PrivyClient} from '@privy-io/node';

const privy = new PrivyClient({
  appId: 'insert-your-app-id',
  appSecret: 'insert-your-app-secret'
});
```

This `privy` **`PrivyClient`** is now your entry point to manage Privy from your server. With the `PrivyClient` you can interact with wallets with methods for creating wallets, signing and sending transactions. You can also manage users with methods for getting a user object, verifying an auth token, and importing new users.

## Rate limits

Privy rate limits REST API endpoints that you may call from your server. If you suspect your team will require an increased rate limit, please reach out to support!
