## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

* Get your [Privy app ID and app secret](/basics/get-started/dashboard/create-new-app) from the Privy Dashboard
* Rust 1.88 or later
* A `tokio` async runtime

## Instantiating the `PrivyClient`

Import the **`PrivyClient`** struct and create an instance by passing your Privy **app ID** and **app secret** as parameters.

```rust  theme={"system"}
use privy_rs::PrivyClient;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = PrivyClient::new(
        "insert-your-app-id".to_string(),
        "insert-your-app-secret".to_string()
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

<Tip>
  You can also store your credentials as environment variables for security:

  ```rust  theme={"system"}
  let app_id = std::env::var("PRIVY_APP_ID")
      .expect("PRIVY_APP_ID environment variable not set");
  let app_secret = std::env::var("PRIVY_APP_SECRET")
      .expect("PRIVY_APP_SECRET environment variable not set");

  let client = PrivyClient::new_from_env()?;
  ```
</Tip>

This `client` **`PrivyClient`** is now your entry point to manage Privy from your server. With the `PrivyClient` you can interact with wallets with methods for creating wallets, signing and sending transactions. You can also manage users with methods for getting a user object, verifying an auth token, and importing new users.

## Authorization

If a resource (i.e. wallet, policy, key quorum) has an [owner](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/overview),
[authorization signatures](/api-reference/authorization-signatures) from the owner are required.
Use the [authorization context](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/sign/signing-on-the-server) to specify authorization private keys
and user JWTs of the wallet's owners, and the Rust SDK will generate signatures and sign requests
under the hood.

<Tip>
  We strongly recommend reading [this
  guide](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/sign/signing-on-the-server) before using the Rust
  SDK for the best development experience.
</Tip>

```rust  theme={"system"}
use privy_rs::{AuthorizationContext, PrivateKey, JwtUser};

let client = PrivyClient::new(app_id, app_secret)?;

let ctx = AuthorizationContext::new()
    .push(JwtUser(client.clone(), "jwt1".to_string()))
    .push(JwtUser(client.clone(), "jwt2".to_string()))
    .push(PrivateKey("authorization-key".to_string()));
```

## Rate limits

Privy rate limits REST API endpoints that you may call from your server. If you suspect your team will require an increased rate limit, please reach out to support!
