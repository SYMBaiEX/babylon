Privy offers the ability to sign up and log users in using a passkey. This lets users access their account simply and securely.

<Tip>
  Enable passkey authentication in the [Privy
  Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io/apps?page=login-methods) before implementing this feature.

    ## Login with Passkey

    <Info>
      To authenticate your users with Privy's out of the box UIs, check out UI components [here](/authentication/user-authentication/ui-component).
    </Info>

    Use `loginWithPasskey` from the `useLoginWithPasskey` hook to trigger the passkey login flow.

    ```jsx  theme={"system"}
    loginWithPasskey: ({ passkey?: string }) => void
    ```

    <ParamField path="passkey" type="string">
      Optionally prompt the user to sign in with a specific passkey credential.
    </ParamField>

    ### Usage

    ```jsx  theme={"system"}
    import { useLoginWithPasskey } from '@privy-io/react-auth';

    export default function LoginWithPasskey() {
      const { loginWithPasskey } = useLoginWithPasskey();

      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={loginWithPasskey}>Log in with passkey</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    ## Sign up with Passkey

    Use `signupWithPasskey` from the `useSignupWithPasskey` hook to trigger the passkey signup flow.

    ```jsx  theme={"system"}
    signupWithPasskey: () => void
    ```

    ### Usage

    ```jsx  theme={"system"}
    import { useSignupWithPasskey } from '@privy-io/react-auth';

    export default function SignupWithPasskey() {
      const { signupWithPasskey } = useSignupWithPasskey();

      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={signupWithPasskey}>Sign up with passkey</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    ## Tracking Flow State

    Track the state of the passkey flow via the `state` variable returned by both the
    `useLoginWithPasskey` and `useSignupWithPasskey` hooks.

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    state:
      | {status: 'initial'}
      | {status: 'error'; error: Error | null}
      | {status: 'generating-challenge'}
      | {status: 'awaiting-passkey'}
      | {status: 'submitting-response'}
      | {status: 'done'};
    ```

    <ResponseField name="status" type="'initial' | 'error' | 'generating-challenge' | 'awaiting-passkey' | 'submitting-response' | 'done'">
      The current state of the passkey flow.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="error" type="Error | null">
      The error that occurred during the passkey flow.
    </ResponseField>

    ## Login with Passkey

    Use `login` from the `privy.passkey` interface to authenticate an existing user who has already registered a passkey. This method allows returning users to log in using their previously created passkey credentials. Before using this method, ensure you have setup passkeys as described in the passkey setup guide.

    ```swift  theme={"system"}
    func login(relyingParty: String) async throws -> PrivyUser
    ```

    ### Parameters

    <ParamField path="relyingParty" type="String" required>
      The URL origin where your Digital Asset Links are available (e.g., `https://example.com`).
    </ParamField>

    ### Returns

    <ResponseField name="PrivyUser" type="PrivyUser">
      The authenticated Privy user
    </ResponseField>

    ### Usage

    ```swift  theme={"system"}
    do {
        let user = try await privy.passkey.login(relyingParty: relyingParty)

        // Successfully authenticated an existing user with a passkey
    } catch {
        print("Login failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
    ```

    ## Sign up with Passkey

    Use `signup` from the `privy.passkey` interface to create a new user account and register a passkey for them. This method creates a new user in your Privy app, whereas `login` authenticates an existing user who has already registered a passkey.

    ```kotlin  theme={"system"}
    func signup(relyingParty: String, displayName: String?) async throws -> PrivyUser
    ```

    ### Parameters

    <ParamField path="relyingParty" type="String" required>
      The URL origin where your Digital Asset Links are available (e.g., `https://example.com`).
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="displayName" type="String">
      An optional display name to associate with the passkey. This name will be shown to the user when selecting which passkey to use for authentication.
    </ParamField>

    ### Returns

    <ResponseField name="PrivyUser" type="PrivyUser">
      The authenticated Privy user
    </ResponseField>

    ### Usage

    ```swift  theme={"system"}
    do {
        let displayName = "Optional Display Name"

        let user = try await privy.passkey.signup(
            relyingParty: relyingParty,
            displayName: displayName
        )

        // Successfully created a new user with authenticated by a passkey

    ### Usage

    ```kotlin  theme={"system"}
    val result = privy.passkey.login(relyingParty = "https://<your-applications-relying-party>")

    result.fold(
        onSuccess = { user ->

        },
        onFailure = { error ->
            // Handle login error
        }
    )
    ```

    ## Sign up with Passkey

    Use `signup` from the `privy.passkey` interface to create a new user account and register a passkey for them. This method creates a new user in your Privy app, whereas `login` authenticates an existing user who has already registered a passkey.

    ```kotlin  theme={"system"}
    suspend fun signup(relyingParty: String, displayName: String? = null): Result<PrivyUser>
    ```

    ### Parameters

    <ParamField path="relyingParty" type="String" required>
      The URL origin where your Digital Asset Links are available (e.g., `https://example.com`).
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="displayName" type="String">
      An optional display name to associate with the passkey. This name will be shown to the user when selecting which passkey to use for authentication.
    </ParamField>

    Returns a `Result<PrivyUser>` containing the user object after successful signup.

  <Tab title="Flutter">
    <Tip>
      To enable passkeys for your Flutter app, you need to set them up for both iOS and Android. Follow the [Android passkeys setup guide](/basics/android/advanced/setup-passkeys), and ensure an apple-app-site-association (AASA) file is present on your domain in the .well-known directory that contains an entry for your app's App ID for the webcredentials service.
    </Tip>

    ## Login with Passkey

    Use `login` from the `privy.passkey` interface to authenticate an existing user who has already registered a passkey. This method allows returning users to log in using their previously created passkey credentials. Before using this method, ensure you have setup passkeys as described in the passkey setup guide.

    ```dart  theme={"system"}
    Future<Result<PrivyUser>> login({
      required String relyingParty,
    })
    ```

    ### Parameters

    <ParamField path="relyingParty" type="String" required>
      The URL origin where your Digital Asset Links are available (e.g., `https://example.com`).
    </ParamField>

    ### Response

    Returns a `Result<PrivyUser>` containing the user object after successful login.

    ### Usage

    ```dart  theme={"system"}
    final result = await privy.passkey.login(
      relyingParty: "https://<your-applications-relying-party>",
    );

    result.fold(
      onSuccess: (user) {
        // Handle successful login
      },
      onFailure: (error) {
        // Handle login error
      },
    );
    ```

    ## Sign up with Passkey

    Use `signup` from the `privy.passkey` interface to create a new user account and register a passkey for them. This method creates a new user in your Privy app, whereas `login` authenticates an existing user who has already registered a passkey.

    ```dart  theme={"system"}
    Future<Result<PrivyUser>> signup({
      required String relyingParty,
      String? displayName,
    })
    ```

    ### Parameters

    <ParamField path="relyingParty" type="String" required>
      The URL origin where your Digital Asset Links are available (e.g., `https://example.com`).
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="displayName" type="String">
      An optional display name to associate with the passkey. This name will be shown to the user when selecting which passkey to use for authentication.
    </ParamField>

    ### Response

    Returns a `Result<PrivyUser>` containing the user object after successful signup.

    ### Usage

    ```dart  theme={"system"}
    final result = await privy.passkey.signup(
      relyingParty: "https://<your-applications-relying-party>",
      displayName: "My Passkey", // optional
    );

    result.fold(
      onSuccess: (user) {
        // Handle successful signup
      },
      onFailure: (error) {
        // Handle signup error
      },
    );
    ```
