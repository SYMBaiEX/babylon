# Setting up wallet MFA for your app

<Danger>
  Once a user enrolls in MFA, it will remain enabled **even if you disable MFA for your app**. Users
  must manually disable MFA on their wallets if they wish to remove it.
</Danger>

To enable MFA for your app, select your desired app from the sidebar and navigate to the **User management > Authentication > MFA** page.

Within the **MFA** tab, scroll down to the **Enable MFA for transactions** section and **select the desired MFA methods** you'd like to enable for your app.

Once you have selected your desired MFA methods and saved changes, you can prompt your users to enroll in any of the methods you've enabled!

Please note that:

* If your app has SMS enabled as a login method, you **may not** enable SMS as an MFA method as well.
  With SMS login enabled, SMS can already be used as the primary factor to authenticate the user for access to their wallet; it cannot be enabled as an additional factor as well.
* To use passkeys as an MFA method, you *must* also enable passkeys as a login method

## Implementation Options

Privy offers two main approaches to implement wallet MFA in your application:

1. **Using Privy's default UIs** - The simplest approach where Privy handles the UI components
2. **Building custom UIs (headless)** - More involved but gives you complete control over the user experience
