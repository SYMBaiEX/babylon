# Using your own authentication provider

Privy supports all JWT-based authentication providers. This includes any OIDC compliant authentication system, including OAuth 2.0, Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, and more.

Using JWT-based authentication integration, you can use your existing authentication system with Privy's services. This approach allows users to maintain their existing login experience while giving them access to embedded wallets.

Privy's authentication is fully compatible with any authentication provider that supports [JWT-based](https://jwt.io/), [stateless](https://auth0.com/blog/stateless-auth-for-stateful-minds/) authentication. When a user logs into your app, your auth provider issues them an access and/or identity token to represent their auth status. Privy validates this token to authenticate your user.
