# Enabling server-side access to user wallets

Signers allow your app to request server-side access to user wallets. This enables your app to execute transactions from user wallets from your servers directly, giving you more control and the ability to execute transactions even when the user is offline (e.g., for limit orders or agentic trading).

You can also configure signers to have specific permissions via [policies](/controls/policies/overview), such that you can request server-side access for only certain transaction types.

At a high-level, you can use signers to request server-side access to user wallets.
