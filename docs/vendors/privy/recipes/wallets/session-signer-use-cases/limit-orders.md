# Using signers to execute limit orders with wallets

Signers allow your app to execute limit orders or other transactions while a user is offline. You can also configure signers such that you can only execute certain orders restricted by specific [policies](/controls/policies/overview) that you define.

At a high-level, you can use signers to execute limit orders.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a signer to the user's wallet">
    Follow the "adding signers quickstart" to first request access to a user's wallet. Store the private key(s) associated with your signer ID securely in your server. Your Telegram bot or agent will need this to execute transaction requests.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute the limit order from your server">
    Next, use Privy's NodeJS SDK or REST API to execute the limit order from your server. When making the request to Privy's API, you must sign the request with the private key(s) associated with your signer ID.

    Follow the guides below to learn how to sign requests and execute transactions on EVM and Solana.
