# Setting up SMS or WhatsApp login

Privy enables your users to log in to their account via SMS or WhatsApp. Your account can be set up for **either** SMS or WhatsApp, but **not both** at the same time. Your chosen configuration will apply to all applications under your Privy account.

<Info>
  We recommend including alternative login options alongside SMS or enabling [Multi-Factor
  Authentication](/authentication/user-authentication/mfa) to ensure broad accessibility in regions
  without SMS coverage and to allow users to access their accounts in the event that they lose SMS
  access.

    2. After you create an account, you'll have access to the Twilio Console, where you can configure a [Verify service](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify) and [region coverage](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/preventing-toll-fraud/verify-geo-permissions).

    3. Reach out to us at [support@privy.io](mailto:support@privy.io) and provide the following Twilio credentials:
