# Quorum approvals

If your business needs multiple parties to be able to approve updates to or actions taken by wallets, the most common setup is to set up a [key quorum](/controls/key-quorum/overview) consisting of a set of multiple [authorization keys](/controls/authorization-keys/keys/create/key) or [users](/controls/authorization-keys/keys/create/user/overview) in your authentication system.

You can define the quorum such that a certain number of members of the quorum must approve actions to wallets. This is known as the quorum's **authorization threshold**. Privy's TEE infrastructure enforces that at least that many members of the quorum must sign the request to take an action with a wallet. To allow multiple parties to unilaterally approve wallet actions, you can set this threshold to 1.

Quorum approvals allow your business to create setups where multiple parties must sign-off on actions taken by wallets, enhancing security and ensuring your wallet setup complies with your business's custody and regulatory stance.
