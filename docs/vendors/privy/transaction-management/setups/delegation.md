# Delegating permissions

Privy wallets' powerful [**owners and signers**](/transaction-management/models/permissions) abstraction allow your application to configure granular permissions around the actions that various parties can take on wallets. Namely, **owners** have full control over wallets and can delegate permissions to **signers** to execute transactions from the wallet within the scope of a specific [**policy**](/transaction-management/models/policies).

A good rule of thumb is:

* If you need **third-parties to take actions on behalf of your business**, configure your business as the wallet's owner and each of the third-parties as a signer.
* If you need **your business to take actions on behalf of a third-party or a user**, configure the third-party as the wallet's owner and your business as a signer.

Owners and signers can be configured flexibly, including support for unilateral or quorum approvals.
