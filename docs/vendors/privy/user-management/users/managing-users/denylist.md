# Denylist

Privy allows your app to enable a **denylist** to block specific users from logging in to your app and creating accounts. You can use the denylist to block users who have previously been malicious in your application or who violate your terms of service.

Currently, Privy denylists support blocking users based on their **email address, phone number, EVM wallet address or Solana wallet address**. You can choose to either block a specific email address (e.g. `bruce@wayneenterprises.com`) or an email domain (e.g. `@wayneenterprises.com`).

<Note>
  Denylists apply to email, SMS, wallet, and OAuth methods with verified emails only. Login methods
  like Telegram and Farcaster are not supported.
</Note>

## Enabling the denylist for your app

You can enable an denylist directly from the [Privy developer dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io). To do so, just navigate to the **Users** page > [Access Control](https://dashboard.privy.io/apps/cm7z7tdvm00oxpsqt25bha0tv/users?tab=access-control) tab of the dashboard and toggle denylists on.

## Managing the denylist

There are two main ways to manage the denylist for your app:

* Using the API, you can easily [add entries](/user-management/users/managing-users/denylist#adding-to-the-deny-list), [remove entries](/user-management/users/managing-users/denylist#removing-from-the-deny-list), and [get your current denylist](/user-management/users/managing-users/denylist#getting-the-deny-list).
* Using the developer dashboard, you can easily [add and remove entries](/user-management/users/managing-users/denylist#adding-to-the-deny-list) from your app's denylist.

## Adding to the denylist

<Info>If you do not have a denylist enabled for your app, this request will fail.</Info>

Privy allows you to easily add an individual email address, phone number, EVM wallet address or Solana wallet address to your denylist.

To add an entry to the denylist, make a `POST` request to:

```sh  theme={"system"}
https://auth.privy.io/api/v1/apps/<your-privy-app-id>/denylist
```

In the body of the request, include the following fields:

<ParamField path="type" type="'email' | 'emailDomain' | 'phoneNumber' | 'ethereumAddress' | 'solanaAddress'" required>
  Specifies that the request adds an email address, email domain, phone number, EVM wallet address
  or Solana wallet address to the denylist.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="value" type="string" required>
  The email address, email domain, phone number, EVM wallet address or Solana wallet address to add
  to the denylist.
</ParamField>

Below is a sample cURL command for adding an email to the denylist:

```bash  theme={"system"}
curl --request POST 'https://auth.privy.io/api/v1/apps/<your-privy-app-id>/denylist' \
-u "<your-privy-app-id>:<your-privy-app-secret>" \
-H "privy-app-id: <your-privy-app-id>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{
  "type": "email",
  "value": "user@email.com"
}'
```

A successful response will include the new denylist entry, like below

```json  theme={"system"}
{
  "id": "denylist-entry-ID",
  "rule_type": "email",
  "value": "user@email.com"
}
```

***

# Removing from the denylist

<Info>If you do not have a denylist enabled for your app, this request will fail.</Info>

To delete an entry from the denylist, make a `DELETE` request to:

```sh  theme={"system"}
https://auth.privy.io/api/v1/apps/<your-privy-app-id>/denylist
```

In the body of the request, include the following fields:

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the denylist entry to be removed. You can obtain this ID by [getting your current deny
  list](/user-management/users/managing-users/denylist).
</ParamField>

Below is a sample cURL command for deleting an email from the denylist:

```bash  theme={"system"}
curl --request DELETE 'https://auth.privy.io/api/v1/apps/<your-privy-app-id>/denylist' \
-u "<your-privy-app-id>:<your-privy-app-secret>" \
-H "privy-app-id: <your-privy-app-id>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{
  "id": "clpa828s4001hl90f6dxoksrg",
}'
```

A successful request will return response code `204`. If there is no corresponding denylist entry, the response will include an error.

***

# Getting the denylist

To get your current denylist, make a `GET` request to:

```sh  theme={"system"}
https://auth.privy.io/api/v1/apps/<your-privy-app-id>/denylist
```

This is a paginated query, and the API will return up to 1000 denylist entries for a single request.

## Parameters

In the **request query parameters**, specify the following fields:

<ParamField path="cursor" type="string">
  When you request a batch of denylist entries from Privy, the API will return a cursor for the *next* batch of denylist entries in the `next_cursor` field of the [response](#response). This will be a denylist ID, which is a `string`.

  If you are requesting the *first* batch of denylist entries for your app, do not include a `cursor` in your request parameters.

  If you have already requested a batch of denylist entries and want to request the next batch, set the `cursor` in your request parameters to be the `next_cursor` returned by the API in your previous query. If the provided `cursor` is not a valid denylist ID, the API will return an error.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="limit" type="number">
  The number of users you would like the API to return. Defaults to 1000.
</ParamField>

As an example, to get the first 1000 denylist entries for your app, you should include *no* URL query parameters:

```sh  theme={"system"}
curl --request GET https://auth.privy.io/api/v1/apps/<your-privy-app-id>/denylist \
-u "<your-privy-app-id>:<your-privy-app-secret>" \
-H "privy-app-id: <your-privy-app-id>"
```

Then, to get the *next* 1000 denylist entries for your app, you should pass the `next_cursor` field of the last response as the `cursor` in your request query parameters:

```sh  theme={"system"}
# Replace <insert-cursor> below with the `next_cursor` returned by the last query
curl --request GET https://auth.privy.io/api/v1/apps/<your-privy-app-id>/denylist?cursor=<insert-cursor> \
-u "<your-privy-app-id>:<your-privy-app-secret>" \
-H "privy-app-id: <your-privy-app-id>"
```

## Response

A successful response will include:

<ResponseField type="array">The denylist entries as an array</ResponseField>

<ResponseField type="string">The cursor to be used in your next request to this API</ResponseField>

Below is an example:

<Expandable title="child attributes" defaultOpen="true">
  ```json  theme={"system"}
  {
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "denylist-entry-ID1",
        "rule_type": "email",
        "value": "user@email.com"
      },
      {
        "id": "denylist-entry-ID2",
        "rule_type": "emailDomain",
        "value": "email.com"
      }
      // ...
    ],
    "next_cursor": "denylist-entry-ID2"
  }
  ```
</Expandable>

If you need to [remove an entry](/user-management/users/managing-users/denylist#removing-from-the-deny-list) from your denylist, you will need the `id` field returned in this API response.
