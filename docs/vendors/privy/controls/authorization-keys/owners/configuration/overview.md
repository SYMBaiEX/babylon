At a high-level, you should determine the minimal permissions your users, your app, and any third parties require for your wallets. Then, **configure each wallet with appropriate owners and additional signers to reflect your desired permissions**.

## Permissions

Owners and signers differ in the permissions over wallets as outlined below.
