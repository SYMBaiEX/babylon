# Overview

Common flows to create self-custodial user wallets include:

* **Creating wallets with a user owner.** This configures wallets such that users are the only entity that can update policies, add additional signers, export the wallet, or change the wallet's owner. If you create wallets via one of Privy's client-side SDKs, your app's wallets are automatically created with user owners.
* **Creating wallets with a *1-of-n* key quorum, where one member of the key quorum is the user**. This gives users full permissions over their wallet, while enabling other parties to easily update wallets (e.g. policies and signers) and take actions with them.

You can extend self-custodial user wallets to support various use cases, as outlined below.
