    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create wallets with a user owner">
        To ensure the wallet can only be controlled by the user, create the wallet with a user
        owner. If you use one of Privy's client-side SDKs to create wallets, wallets are created
        with a user owner by default.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Request a signature over your transaction request">
        [Construct your transaction request](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/sign) and use
        Privy's [client-side SDKs'
        methods](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/sign#react%2C-expo) to have the user sign
        the transaction request.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Execute the transaction request from your server">
        Send your user's authorization signature from your client to your server, and [send your
        transaction request](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/action) with the user's
        signature to Privy's API.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

      <Step title="Create wallets with a user owner">
        To ensure the wallet can only be controlled by the user, create the wallet with a user

        with a user owner by default.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Request a user key">
        Next, given a user's access token from your authentication provider, [request a user
        key](/controls/authorization-keys/keys/create/user/request) from Privy's API. You will use
        this key to sign transaction requests to Privy's aPI.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Sign the request with your user key">
        Next, [construct your transaction request](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/sign)
        and [sign the transaction request](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/sign) with the
        user key
      </Step>

      <Step title="Execute the transaction request from your server">
        Send your user's authorization signature from your client to your server, and [send your
        transaction request](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/action) with the user's
        signature to Privy's API.
