# Using user owners & signers

Once your application has successfully configured authentication settings, users can update and take actions with resources they own per the following flow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request a user key for a user">
    Make a request to the Privy API with the user's access token to request a user key. If the token
    is valid per your configured authentication settings, Privy will return a time-bound user key
    that can be used to sign requests.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign the request with the user key">
    Given the returned user key, [sign the request](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/sign)
    to update or take actions with a resource the user owns.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pass the signature in request headers">
    Lastly, [pass the signature](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/action) from the user key
    in a `privy-authorization-signature` header for the request. Privy will verify the signature and
    execute the request only if the signature is valid.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Follow the guide below to learn how to request and use user keys from the Privy API.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS">
    ### Set the authorization context to use the user's keypair

    Given the user's access token, the NodeJS SDK handles requesting the user key via the Privy API under
    the hood. Use the [authorization context](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/sign/signing-on-the-server) builder to set the user
    JWT, and pass it into wallet API functions that require owner's authorization, by setting the
    `user_jwts` property.

    ```ts  theme={"system"}
    import {AuthorizationContext} from '@privy-io/node';

    const authorizationContext: AuthorizationContext = {
      user_jwts: ['insert-user-jwt']
    };
    ```

    Wallet requests on the wallets owned by the user can now be made by passing in this newly created
    authorization context on the call to the `PrivyClient`.

    ```ts title="Example: Sign a message with the user's wallet" highlight={15-17} theme={"system"}
    import {PrivyClient} from '@privy-io/node';

    const privyClient = new PrivyClient({
      appId: 'insert-your-app-id',
      appSecret: 'insert-your-app-secret'
    });

    try {
      // With the authorization context, this method automatically signs the request.
      const response = await privyClient
        .wallets()
        .ethereum()
        .signMessage('insert-user-wallet-id', {
          message: 'Hello, Ethereum.',
          authorization_context: {
            user_jwts: ['insert-user-jwt']
          }
        });

      const signature = response.signature;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="NodeJS (server-auth)">
    <Warning>
      The `@privy-io/server-auth` library is deprecated. We recommend integrating `@privy-io/node` for
      the latest features and support.
    </Warning>

    #### 1. Request a user key for a user

    To request a user key with the NodeJS SDK, use the `generateUserSigner` method of the Privy client.

    ```ts  theme={"system"}
    import {PrivyClient} from '@privy-io/server-auth';

    const privy = new PrivyClient('insert-your-app-id', 'insert-your-app-secret');

    const {authorizationKey} = await privy.walletApi.generateUserSigner({
      userJwt: 'insert-user-jwt'
    });
    ```

    As a parameter to the method, pass an object containing the following.

    <ParamField path="userJwt" type="string" required>
      The user's JWT, to authenticate the user.

      If your app is using your own authentication provider, the user's JWT should verify against the JWKS.json endpoint you registered in the Dashboard.

      If your app is using Privy as your authentication provider, the user's JWT should be the access token issued by Privy.
    </ParamField>

    <Tip>
      Under the hood, the `generateUserSigner` method handles the encryption and decryption of the user
      key returned by the Privy API. This means your application does not need to handle the encryption
      of the user key.
    </Tip>

    #### 2. Update the Privy client to use the user's keypair

    Once you've generated a user authorization key for the user, update the Privy client to use the user authorization key via the `updateAuthorizationKey` method. This will configure the Privy client to sign requests with the provided key.

    ```ts  theme={"system"}
    import {PrivyClient} from '@privy-io/server-auth';

    const privy = new PrivyClient('insert-your-app-id', 'insert-your-app-secret');

    privy.walletApi.updateAuthorizationKey('insert-user-authorization-key');
    ```

    As a parameter to this method, pass the user authorization key returned by the `generateUserSigner` method as a `string`.

    #### 3. Execute requests with the user's authorization key

    Once the Privy client has been updated with a specific user's authorization key, the client will automatically sign requests made by the [`privy.walletApi.ethereum.*`](/wallets/using-wallets/ethereum/send-a-transaction) and [`privy.walletApi.solana.*`](/wallets/using-wallets/solana/send-a-transaction) methods. You do not need to take any extra steps to sign requests.

  <Tab title="Java">
    ### Set the authorization context to use the user's keypair

    Given the user's access token, the Java SDK handles requesting the user key via the Privy API under
    the hood. Use the [authorization context](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/sign/signing-on-the-server) builder to set the user
    JWT, and pass it into wallet API functions that require owner's authorization, by using
    `.addUserJwt()`.

    ```java  theme={"system"}
        AuthorizationContext authorizationContext = AuthorizationContext.builder()
            .addUserJwt("insert-user-jwt")
            .build();
    ```

    Wallet requests on the wallets owned by the user can now be made by passing in this newly created
    authorization context on the call to the `PrivyClient`.

    ```java title="Example: Sign a message with the user's wallet" highlight={4-6,14} theme={"system"}

        AuthorizationContext authorizationContext = AuthorizationContext.builder()
            .addUserJwt("insert-user-jwt")
            .build();

        // With the authorization context, this method automatically signs the request.
        EthereumPersonalSignRpcResponseData response = privyClient

                message.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8),
                authorizationContext
            );

        String signature = response.signature();
    } catch (APIException e) {
        String errorBody = e.bodyAsString();
        System.err.println(errorBody);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.err.println(e.getMessage());
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="REST API">
    <Info>
      Directly managing user authorization keys via the REST API is an advanced integration. If you are
      using a Privy SDK, you do not need to directly manage the user's authorization key or manually
      generate authorization signatures.
    </Info>

    <Tip>
      For security, Privy encrypts user authorization keys under a public key you provide to ensure that only your app can decrypt them. If you are just getting started with your integration, you can test the flow without encryption by following the **Without encryption** sections of the guide below.

      In production environments, we strongly recommend requesting user authorization keys **with encryption** as a security best practice.
    </Tip>

    #### 1. Generate an ECH P-256 keypair

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="With encryption">
        To begin, create an [ECH P-256](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/workshop-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography-standards/documents/papers/session6-adalier-mehmet.pdf) public-private keypair to encrypt and decrypt your user's authorization key. Privy will encrypt the authorization under the public key for your keypair, and your server can decrypt the authorization key using the keypair's corresponding private key.

        When interacting with the Privy API, your ECH P-256 public-private keypair must be in the [SPKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_public-key_infrastructure) format.

        As an example, you can create an ECH P-256 keypair like so.

    ### 4. Sign requests with the authorization key

    Now that you have successfully retrieved the authorization key for your user, continue to [this guide](/controls/authorization-keys/using-owners/sign) to learn how to sign requests to the Privy API.
