# Fetch transaction via API

<Warning>
  The following functionality exists for [wallets reconstituted
  server-side](/wallets/wallets/create/create-a-wallet). More on [Privy architecture
  here](/security/wallet-infrastructure/architecture)
</Warning>

<Note>
  In August 2025 we migrated transactions to a new data store. As part of this migration, we changed
  the format of transaction IDs from CUID2 to UUIDv4. You may continue using the CUID2 for your
  existing transactions, but we encourage migration to the new UUID, as it will avoid a very slight
  latency increase due to an extra lookup for mapping from the legacy ID to the new ID.

  <Tab title="NodeJS">
    To get a transaction's details using the NodeJS SDK, use the `get` method on the `transactions()` interface of the Privy client:

    ### Usage

    ```typescript  theme={"system"}
    import {PrivyClient} from '@privy-io/node';

    const privy = new PrivyClient({
      appId: 'insert-your-app-id',
      appSecret: 'insert-your-app-secret'
    });

    const transaction = await privy.transactions().get('insert-transaction-id');
    console.log(transaction);
    ```

    ### Parameters and Returns

    Check out the [API reference](/api-reference/transactions/get) for more details.

  <Tab title="NodeJS (server-auth)">
    <Warning>
      The `@privy-io/server-auth` library is deprecated. We recommend integrating `@privy-io/node` for
      the latest features and support.
    </Warning>

    To get a transaction's details using the NodeJS SDK, use the `getTransaction` method from the Privy client:

    ```typescript {skip-check} theme={"system"}
    getTransaction: (input: {id: string}) => Promise<WalletApiTransactionResponseType>;
    ```

    ### Usage

    ```typescript  theme={"system"}
    import {PrivyClient} from '@privy-io/server-auth';

    const privy = new PrivyClient('insert-your-app-id', 'insert-your-app-secret');

    const transaction = await privy.walletApi.getTransaction({
      id: 'insert-transaction-id'
    });
    console.log(transaction);
    ```

    ### Parameters

    <ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
      ID of the transaction to fetch details for.
    </ParamField>

    ### Returns

    <ResponseField name="transaction" type="WalletApiTransactionResponseType">
      <Expandable title="WalletApiTransactionResponseType" defaultOpen="true">
        <ResponseField name="id" type="string">
          ID for the transaction.
        </ResponseField>

        <ResponseField name="walletId" type="string">
          ID for the wallet that sent the transaction.
        </ResponseField>

        <ResponseField name="caip2" type="string">
          CAIP-2 chain ID for the network the transaction was broadcasted on.
        </ResponseField>

        <ResponseField name="transactionHash" type="string">
          Hash for the transaction.
        </ResponseField>

        <ResponseField name="status" type="'broadcasted' | 'confirmed' | 'execution_reverted' | 'failed' | 'replaced' | 'pending' | 'provider_error'">
          Current status of the transaction. - `'broadcasted'` refers to when a transaction has been
          submitted to the network but has not yet been included in a block - `'confirmed'` refers to when a
          transaction has been included in a block that has been confirmed on the network. -
          `'execution_reverted'` refers to when a transaction has reverted in execution. - `'failed'` refers
          to when a transaction has been pending for too long, signaling that it will not be included
          on-chain. This can happen when the gas fee is too low given the current activity on the blockchain
          and is only triggered for chains that have a defined pending time limit (e.g. Base, Solana,
          Flow.). - `'replaced'` refers to when a transaction has been replaced by another transaction with
          the same nonce. This is only applicable to EVM chains. - `'pending'` irefers to when a custodial
          wallet transaction has been initiated with the custodian and is undergoing processing. -
          `'provider_error'` refers to when a custodial wallet transaction request has been rejected by the
          custodian or encountered an error. This can happen when you attempt to spend funds that haven't
          been fully screened by the custodian yet, or when a transaction does not meet the custodian's
          compliance requirements.

  <Tab title="REST API">
    Privy supports fetching transaction status by the transaction ID.

    To do so, make a `GET` request to

    ```bash  theme={"system"}
    https://api.privy.io/v1/transactions/<transaction_id>
    ```

    replacing `<transaction_id>` with the ID of your desired transaction.

    <ResponseField name="id" type="string">
      ID for the transaction.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="wallet_id" type="string">
      ID for the wallet that sent the transaction.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="status" type="'broadcasted' | 'confirmed' | 'execution_reverted' | 'failed' | 'replaced' | 'pending' | 'provider_error'">
      Current status of the transaction. - `'broadcasted'` refers to when a transaction has been

    <ResponseField name="caip2" type="string">
      CAIP-2 chain ID for the network the transaction was broadcasted on.

    ## Example

    For example, you might fetch a transactions status using transaction ID using the `cURL` request below.

    ```bash  theme={"system"}
    $ curl --request GET https://api.privy.io/v1/transactions/<transaction_id> \
    -u "<your-privy-app-id>:<your-privy-app-secret>" \
    -H "privy-app-id: <your-privy-app-id>" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    ```

    The response might look like

    ```json  theme={"system"}
    {
      "id": "<transaction_id>",
      "wallet_id": "fmfdj6yqly31huorjqzq38zc",
      "status": "confirmed",
      "transaction_hash": "0x2446f1fd773fbb9f080e674b60c6a033c7ed7427b8b9413cf28a2a4a6da9b56c",
      "caip2": "eip155:8453"
    }
    ```
