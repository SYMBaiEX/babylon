# Smart wallets

Privy makes it easy to create **smart wallets** for your users. Smart wallets are **programmable, onchain accounts** that incorporate the features of [account abstraction](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/). With just a few lines of code, you can create smart wallets for your users to sponsor gas payments, send batched transactions, and more.

<Tip>
  We recommend using our native gas sponsorship offering to sponsor transactions on EVM and Solana.

</Tip>

<Info>
  Please note that this native smart wallet integration is only available in the React and React
  Native SDKs. To configure smart wallets with wallets created using server-side SDKs or APIs,
  follow [this guide](/wallets/gas-and-asset-management/gas/ethereum).

To set up with smart wallets, start by [enabling smart wallets in the Privy Dashboard](/wallets/using-wallets/evm-smart-wallets/setup/configuring-dashboard). This will configure your app to create smart wallets for your users controlled by Privy embedded signers.

### Native ERC-4337 support with embedded signers

Under the hood, a smart wallet is an [ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/)-compatible smart contract deployed onchain. This smart contract can be programmed to support features like transaction batching, gas sponsorship, delegating permissions, and more.

When using a smart wallet, a user's assets are held by the smart contract itself. This smart contract is controlled by an **embedded signer** (an externally-owned account) secured by Privy's self-custodial wallet infrastructure. Privy automatically takes care of creating signers for users and generating smart contract wallets controlled by these signers.

Your app can customize which ERC-4337 account *implementation* powers your users' smart wallets, between Kernel (ZeroDev), Safe, LightAccount (Alchemy), Biconomy, Thirdweb, and the Coinbase Smart Wallet.

<Info>
  Privy partners with the ERC-4337 account providers above to ensure a smooth experience. If you'd
  like us to add support for another, please [reach out](https://privy.io/slack)!
</Info>

### Gas sponsorship with paymasters

With smart wallets, your app can pay for gas fees simply by registering a paymaster URL in the Privy Dashboard. Privy will automatically route gas payments from your registered paymaster instead of your users' wallets, allowing your users to transact on-chain *instantly* –– even if they don't have a balance in their smart wallet.

### Future-proofed for the latest standards

Privy works closely with the teams building the next generation of account abstraction standards on top of ERC-4337, such as permissions & session keys ([ERC-7715](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7715-grant-permissions-from-wallets/20100)), smart wallet modules ([ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com/)), and smart account discovery ([ERC-7555](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7555-single-sign-on-for-account-discovery/16536)) across different applications. As these standards become ratified, Privy will incorporate native support for these features.
