# Switch chains

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="React">
    To switch the network of a connected wallet, first [find the corresponding **`ConnectedWallet`** object](/wallets/wallets/get-a-wallet) from the **`wallets`** array.

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    const {wallets} = useWallets();
    const wallet = wallets[0]; // Replace this with your desired wallet
    ```

    Then, call the wallet's **`switchChain`** method. As a parameter to the method, pass the chain ID for your desired network as a `number` or hexadecimal `string`:

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    await wallet.switchChain(7777777);
    ```

    For embedded wallets, **`switchChain`** will update the network of the embedded wallet behind the scenes. For external wallets, **`switchChain`** will prompt the user to switch to the target network within the external wallet's client (e.g. their browser extension or mobile app).

    **`switchChain`** returns a Promise that resolves to `void` once the wallet has successfully been switched to the target network. The Promise will reject with an error if:

    * The target chain has [not been configured](/basics/react/advanced/configuring-evm-networks).
    * The user declines the request to switch their network, if using an external wallet.

    By default, embedded wallets will be connected to the first network specified in your **`supportedChains`** array, and to Ethereum mainnet if no **`supportedChains`** are specified.

    To switch the embedded wallet to a different network, **send a [`wallet_switchEthereumChain`](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/wallet_switchethereumchain/) JSON-RPC request to the wallet's EIP-1193 provider.** In the request's **`params`**, specify your target **`chainId`** as a hexadecimal string.

    ```ts  theme={"system"}
    import {useEmbeddedEthereumWallet} from '@privy-io/expo';

    const {wallets} = useEmbeddedEthereumWallet();
    const wallet = wallets[0]; // Replace this with your desired wallet

    const provider = await wallet.getProvider();
    await provider.request({
      method: 'wallet_switchEthereumChain',
      // Replace '0x5' with the chainId of your target network
      params: [{chainId: '0x5'}]
    });
    ```

    You can also use the **`eth_chainId`** request (with no **`params`**) to get the current network of the embedded wallet.
