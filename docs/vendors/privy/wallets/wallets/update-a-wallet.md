# Update a wallet

Privy enables you to update the policies, owners, and signers for a wallet.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="REST API">
    To update an existing wallet, make a `PATCH` request to:

    ```
    https://api.privy.io/v1/wallets/<wallet_id>
    ```

    <Info>
      Wallets with `owner_id` present must provide an [authorization signature](/api-reference/authorization-signatures) as a request header. Privy SDKs offer utility functions such as `generateAuthorizationSignature` to generate the authorization signature.
    </Info>

    ### Body

    In the request body, include the following fields:

    <ParamField path="policy_ids" type="string[]">
      New policy IDs to enforce on the wallet. Currently, only one policy is supported per wallet.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField type="{user_id: string} | {public_key: string} | null" path="owner">
      The user ID or P-256 public key of the owner of the wallet. If you provide this, do not specify an owner\_id as it will be generated automatically.

      View [this guide](/controls/authorization-keys/owners/overview) to learn more about owners.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField type="string | null" path="owner_id">
      The key quorum ID of the owner of the wallet. If you provide this, do not specify an owner.

      View [this guide](/controls/authorization-keys/owners/overview) to learn more about owners.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField type="{signer_id: string}[]" path="additional_signers">
      The key quorum IDs to add as additional signers for the wallet.

      View [this guide](/controls/key-quorum/overview) to learn more about key quorums.
    </ParamField>

    Any fields not included in the `PATCH` request body will remain unchanged from the original wallet.

    ### Response

    If the wallet is updated successfully, the response will include the updated wallet.

    <ResponseField name="id" type="string">
      Unique ID for the wallet.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="address" type="string">
      Address of the wallet.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="chain_type" type="'ethereum'">
      Chain type for the wallet.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="policy_ids" type="MethodRule">
      Updated policy IDs to enforce on the wallet.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField type="string | null" name="owner_id">
      The key quorum ID of the owner of the wallet.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField type="{signer_id: string}[]" name="additional_signers">
      The key quorum IDs of the additional signers for the wallet.
    </ResponseField>

    ### Example

    A sample request might look like the following:

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    $ curl --request PATCH https://api.privy.io/v1/wallets/rbokq6mmq5f8j1cgyr6a5g4n \
    -u "<your-privy-app-id>:<your-privy-app-secret>" \
    -H "privy-app-id: <your-privy-app-id>" \
    -H "privy-authorization-signature: <authorization-signature-for-request>" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "policy_ids": ["fmfdj6yqly31huorjqzq38zc"],
        "owner_id": "yhu8t1fjns9rtc2o702ub3vt",
        "additional_signers": [{"signer_id": "trt9syg5k19jvxwbnt6t8rd0"}]
    }'
    ```

    A successful response will look like the following:

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    {
      "id": "rbokq6mmq5f8j1cgyr6a5g4n",
      "address": "0xE315ce0854CcbdB0E33e71af1190F48Eb5d4f5a4",

        {
          "signer_id": "trt9syg5k19jvxwbnt6t8rd0"
        }
      ],
      "created_at": 1737492220389
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Java">
    To update an existing wallet, use the `update` method, passing in a `walletId` along with a
    `WalletUpdateRequestBody`.

    ### Usage

    ```java  theme={"system"}
    try {
        WalletUpdateRequestBody request = WalletUpdateRequestBody.builder()
            .policyIds(List.of("new-policy-id"))
            .build();

        // Use the AuthorizationContext to sign the request with the wallet's owner.
        // Example if the wallet's owner is an authorization private key
        AuthorizationContext authorizationContext = AuthorizationContext.builder()
            .addAuthorizationPrivateKey("authorization-key")
            .build();

        WalletUpdateResponse response = privyClient.wallets().update(
            "wallet-id",
            request,
            authorizationContext
        );

        if (response.wallet().isPresent()) {
            Wallet updatedWallet = response.wallet().get();
        }
    } catch (APIException e) {
        String errorBody = e.bodyAsString();
        System.err.println(errorBody);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.err.println(e.getMessage());
    }
    ```

    <ParamField body="policyIds" type="List<String>">
      List of policy IDs for policies that should be enforced on the wallet. Currently, only one policy
      is supported per wallet.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="owner" type="OwnerInput">
      The owner of the resource, which can either be a public key from a p256 keypair, or a user ID. If
      you provide this, do not specify an `ownerId` as it will be generated automatically.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="ownerId" type="String">
      The key quorum ID to set as the owner of the resource. If you provide this, do not specify
      an`owner`.

  <Tab title="Rust">
    To update an existing wallet, use the `update` method on the `wallets()` interface, along with an `AuthorizationContext` for signing the request.

    <Info>
      Wallets with an `owner_id` must provide authorization from the owner to perform updates. Use the `AuthorizationContext` to include the necessary credentials for request signing.
    </Info>

    ### Usage

    ```rust  theme={"system"}
    use privy_rs::{PrivyClient, generated::types::*, AuthorizationContext};

    let client = PrivyClient::new(app_id, app_secret)?;

    // Create authorization context with the wallet owner's key
    let ctx = AuthorizationContext::new()
        .push(PrivateKey("authorization-private-key".to_string()));

    let updated_wallet = client
        .wallets()
        .update(
            "wallet-id",
            &ctx,
            &WalletUpdateBody {
                policy_ids: Some(vec!["new-policy-id".to_string()]),
                owner: None,
                owner_id: Some("new-owner-quorum-id".to_string()),
                additional_signers: Some(vec![
                    WalletAdditionalSigner {
                        signer_id: "additional-signer-id".to_string(),
                    },
                ]),
            },
        )
