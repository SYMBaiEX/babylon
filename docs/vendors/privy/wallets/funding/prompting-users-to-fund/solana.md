# Solana

<Note>
  This page walks through a client-side funding integration for Solana wallets. If you are looking
  to integrate server-side for funding via bank transfer, see the [Funding via bank
  transfer](../methods/bank-account) page.
</Note>

# Prompting users to fund wallets

With funding methods enabled for your app, Privy will prompt users to fund their wallets at two points in their experience:

1. Manually, when you call Privy's `fundWallet` method documented below
2. Automatically, when the user attempts to send a transaction but has insufficient funds

You can also configure the chain, asset, and amount that users should fund their wallets with directly in code.

## Manually invoking funding

Once you've enabled a set of funding methods for your app, to invoke the funding flow, use the **`useFundWallet`** hook from the Privy SDK as follows:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="React">
    Prompt the user to fund their wallets by calling `fundWallet`.

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    import {useFundWallet} from '@privy-io/react-auth/solana';
    ...
    const {fundWallet} = useFundWallet();
    await fundWallet({address: 'your-wallet-address-here'});
    ```

    Once invoked, the **`fundWallet`** method will open a modal that contains a list of funding options the user can take. If only one funding method was enabled for your app, Privy will navigate the user directly to that specific flow.

    You can pass additional configurations to the funding flow in the `options` parameter to **`fundWallet`**.

    <Warning>
      Purchases with third-party providers are not always instantaneous, and there may be some time
      before the user completes their purchase and the funds are available in their wallet.
    </Warning>

    ## Automatically invoking funding

    With funding methods enabled for your app, if a user attempts to send a transaction but does not have sufficient funds to do so, Privy will show them an "Add funds" button in the transaction modal that enables them to invoke funding flows.

    ## Setting a funding amount in code

    Optionally, you can pass in a **chain, funding amount, and funding asset** to `fundWallet` to override your Dashboard configuration.

    To do so, in the `options` parameter to `fundWallet`, pass an object with the following fields:

    | Parameter                       | Type                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
    | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `cluster`                       | `{name: Cluster}`                              | Optional. An object for the [Cluster](https://solana-foundation.github.io/solana-web3.js/types/Cluster.html) on which users should fund their accounts. Defaults to `mainnet-beta`.                                                                                                          |
    | `amount`                        | `string`                                       | Required if `asset` is set, optional otherwise. The amount of the asset to fund as a decimal string. Defaults to the amount you configured in the Privy Dashboard.                                                                                                                           |
    | `defaultFundingMethod`          | `'card' \| 'exchange' \| 'wallet' \| 'manual'` | Optional. Specifying the default funding method will send the user directly to the card / exchange provider, directly open the wallet transfer, or directly open the manual QR wallet transfer screen. Additional configured payment options will be shown after the default funding method. |
    | `card.preferredProvider`        | `'coinbase' \| 'moonpay'`                      | Optional. The preferred card provider to use for funding. If not specified, users will be directed to one of these providers initially and given an option to navigate to a different later.                                                                                                 |
    | `uiConfig.receiveFundsTitle`    | `string`                                       | Optional. Configure the title of the "Receive funds" screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
    | `uiConfig.receiveFundsSubtitle` | `string`                                       | Optional. Configure the subtitle of the "Receive funds" screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

    As examples, you can configure the cluster, amount, and provider to fund like below:

    #### Fund with SOL

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    // `fundWallet` from the useFundWallet() hook
    fundWallet({
      address: 'your-wallet-address-here',
      options: {
        cluster: {name: 'devnet'},
        amount: '0.01' // SOL
      }
    });
    ```

    #### Fund with Moonpay

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    fundWallet({
      address: 'your-wallet-address-here',
      options: {
        amount: '0.01', // SOL
        card: {
          preferredProvider: 'moonpay'
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    #### Fund with Coinbase exchange immediately

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    // `fundWallet` from the useFundWallet() hook
    fundWallet({
      address: 'your-wallet-address-here',
      options: {
        amount: '0.01',
        card: {
          preferredProvider: 'coinbase'
        },
        defaultFundingMethod: 'exchange'
      }
    });
    ```

    ## Callbacks

    To understand when users have gone through a funding flow, you can use the `onUserExited` callback that can be provided to the **`useFundWallet`** hook. The `address`, `chain`, `fundingMethod`, and `balance` (value of the wallet being funded) are available via the callback, which fires when users exit the funding flow.

    For example, if you want to prompt a user to fund their wallet upon logging in for the first time as a part of your onboarding flow:

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    const {fundWallet} = useFundWallet({
      onUserExited({balance}) {
        if (balance < 1000n) {
          router.push('/insufficient-funds');
        } else {
          router.push('/dashboard');
        }
      }
    });

    const {login} = useLogin({
      onComplete(user, isNewUser) {
        if (isNewUser && user.wallet?.walletClientType === 'privy') {
          fundWallet({address: user.wallet.address});
        } else {
          router.push('/dashboard');
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    ## Customizing the "Receive funds" screen

    Privy allows to customize the "Receive funds" screen by providing `uiConfig` options in the `fundWallet` method. You can set the `receiveFundsTitle` and `receiveFundsSubtitle` to customize the title and subtitle of the screen.

    You can then call `fundWallet` like so to customize the UI:

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    import {useFundWallet} from '@privy-io/react-auth';

    // ...
    const {fundWallet} = useFundWallet();
    fundWallet({
      address: 'your-wallet-address-here',
      options: {
        uiConfig: {
          receiveFundsTitle: 'Receive 0.05 SOL',
          receiveFundsSubtitle: 'Scan this code or copy your wallet address to receive funds on Solana.'
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    This will change the default "Receive funds" screen to:

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="React Native">
    <Tip>
      Make sure `<PrivyElements />` is mounted first, by following [this
      guide](/authentication/user-authentication/ui-component).
    </Tip>

    Prompt the user to fund their wallets by calling `fundSolanaWallet`.

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    import { useFundSolanaWallet } from "@privy-io/expo/ui";
    ...
    const {fundWallet} = useFundSolanaWallet();
    await fundWallet({address: 'your-wallet-address-here'});
    ```

    Once invoked, the **`fundWallet`** method will open a modal that contains a list of funding options the user can take.

    You can pass additional configurations to the funding flow in the second, optional parameter to **`fundWallet`**.

    <Warning>
      Purchases with third-party providers are not always instantaneous, and there may be some time
      before the user completes their purchase and the funds are available in their wallet.
    </Warning>

    ## Setting a funding amount in code

    Optionally, you can pass in a **chain, funding amount, and funding asset** to `fundWallet` to override your Dashboard configuration.

    To do so, as the second, optional parameter to `fundWallet`, pass an object with the following fields:

    | Parameter                | Type                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
    | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `address`                | `string`                      | The destination address to fund.                                                                                                                                                               |
    | `cluster`                | `SolanaCluster`               | Optional. An object for the cluster on which users should fund their accounts. Defaults to `mainnet-beta`.                                                                                     |
    | `asset`                  | `'native-currency' \| 'USDC'` | Optional. The asset you'd like the user to fund their accounts with. Set `'native-currency'` to use the app's configured asset or `'USDC'` to fund with USDC. Defaults to `'native-currency'`. |
    | `amount`                 | `string`                      | Required if `asset` is set, optional otherwise. The amount of the asset to fund as a decimal string. Defaults to the amount you configured in the Privy Dashboard.                             |
    | `defaultPaymentMethod`   | `'card' \| 'exchange'`        | Optional. If provided, skip the payment method selection screen and immediately trigger the funding flow with the provider.                                                                    |
    | `card.preferredProvider` | `'coinbase' \| 'moonpay'`     | Optional. Configure the 3rd-party provider for card based funding flows.                                                                                                                       |

    As an example, you can configure the cluster and amount to fund like so:

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    import {useFundSolanaWallet} from '@privy-io/expo/ui';
    // ...
    const {fundWallet} = useFundSolanaWallet();
    fundWallet({
      address: 'your-wallet-address-here',
      amount: '0.01', // SOL
      defaultPaymentMethod: 'card',
      card: {
        preferredProvider: 'coinbase'
      }
    });
    ```

    <Tip>
      To skip directly to the provider's on-ramp experience you can use the `defaultPaymentMethod`
      option.
    </Tip>
