# Funding via exchange

The **transfer from exchange** funding option enables users to purchase or transfer assets from an existing Coinbase exchange account, via [Coinbase Onramp](https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform/products/onramp) embedded within your app. If users have already completed KYC and identity verification with Coinbase for their Coinbase account, they will not need to do so again, streamlining their asset purchase/transfer experience.

If a user chooses to fund via Coinbase Onramp, Privy will prompt the user to fund with the [amount](/wallets/funding/configuration#set-a-default-chain-and-amount) you configure in Dashboard by opening Coinbase in a pop-up window. Once the purchase is complete, this window will automatically close and users can continue in your application.

Please note that these purchases are not immediate and it may take a few minutes for funds to arrive in your user's wallet.

<Warning>
  Transfers and purchases via exchange on-ramps (e.g. Coinbase Onramp) are only supported on
  mainnets. On testnets (e.g. Polygon Amoy, Sepolia), on-ramps cannot purchase testnet tokens, so
  this flow will not be shown or will fail.
</Warning>

<Info>
  When transferring from an exchange, users can fund their accounts with a network's native currency (e.g. ETH, SOL) or USDC on Coinbase Onramp's [supported networks](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/get-started/supported-networks).

  Note that not all payment methods are available in all regions due to local regulations. See [this guide](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp/docs/payment-methods/) for more information on which payment methods are supported in which regions.
