# User authorization keys

[Authorization keys](/security/wallet-infrastructure/policy-and-controls) are the core primitive for control of Privy's [Wallet API](/security/wallet-infrastructure/architecture). Authorization key signatures prove that requests are authorized directly by the permitted user.

**Self-custodial** wallets are those owned directly by a user. Privy enables users to fully control their wallets by issuing time-bound authorization keys to users who authenticate via a verified JWT. Once users retrieve a time-bound authorization key, they can make requests with the key. This configuration results in cryptographically-enforced user custody of wallets.

<Tip>All Privy client-side SDKs enable **fully user self-custodial wallets by default**.</Tip>

### Authentication methods

Privy integrates directly with any OIDC or JWT-based authentication system and also offers [dozens of login methods natively](/security/authentication/user-authentication), including email, SMS, social login, passkeys, and more. If a user is logged in, they always have access to their wallet.

### Multi-factor authentication

Privy also enables multi-factor authentication for access to user authorization keys. Supported additional factors include:

* Authenticator apps (TOTP)
* Biometric verification (passkeys)
* SMS confirmation
* Hardware security keys

This means your app can require additional user verification for sensitive wallet operations. [Learn more](/authentication/user-authentication/mfa#mfa)

## Direct access via API

<Info>
  Directly managing user authorization keys via the API is an advanced setting. We recommend using
  Privy’s SDKs, which internally manage user authorization keys.
</Info>

Privy enables users to retrieve a **time-bound authorization key directly via a REST API**. This API can be called from either your app's frontend or backend.

Privy infrastructure issues authorization keys from within trusted execution environments (TEEs)—see [TEE architecture](/security/wallet-infrastructure/architecture) for more information. Privy integrates with any asymmetric JWT-based authentication system, such as Privy's native authentication system, Auth0, Firebase, or any OIDC or OAuth authentication provider.

The architecture works as follows:

1. Your app makes a request to the Privy API using the authentication token from your JWT-based authentication system.
2. The TEE issues a time-bound user authorization key in response.
3. Use the authorization key to authorize requests to the Wallet API.

The following diagram illustrates an server-side integration. Note that Privy client-side SDKs fully manage direct client-side integrations.

When you use a Privy SDK to provision and transact with user wallets, the SDK fully manages user authorization keys internally.

### Encryption

The returned time-bound authorization key is encrypted from the TEE to the client using HPKE (Hybrid Public Key Encryption), using the same method used by the [wallet export API](/api-reference/wallets/export).
