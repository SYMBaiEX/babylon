> 
>

**DM LEAK 3.2 – Additional Bot Details**

> **DM from `algo-developer-anon`:**  
> "I work on the trading algorithms. The panic signal was embedded in a data update we received from a 'trusted source.' By the time we detected it, the cascade had already started. We lost control in 3 minutes. This was a coordinated attack on commodity markets."
