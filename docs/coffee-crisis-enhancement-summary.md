# Coffee Crisis Timeline Enhancement Summary

**Note:** This is a specific implementation example following the `story-generation-guide.md` framework.

## Overview

The Coffee Crisis storyline demonstrates the story generation framework with **30+ personas** reacting naturally throughout the 10-day timeline. Each persona's reactions are tailored to their personality, domain expertise, and posting style.

**Note:** This is a **single-market story** with one primary prediction market that resolves at the end. For multi-market stories where multiple markets open and close during the timeline, see `epstain-files-enhancement-summary.md`.

## Files Created

1. **`coffee-crisis-timeline-enhanced.md`** - Core timeline with actor reactions integrated at each day
2. **`coffee-crisis-alternative-posts-enhanced.md`** - Alternative posts/leaks with actor-specific variations
3. **`coffee-crisis-endings-enhanced.md`** - Four outcome branches with comprehensive actor reactions
4. **`story-generation-guide.md`** - General framework for creating prediction market stories

## Key Enhancements

### Market Structure

The primary prediction market question is:
- **"Will the global coffee shortage cause an economic collapse?"**

This is a clear, specific question that resolves based on whether economic collapse actually occurs.

Additional related markets may appear throughout the timeline:
- Day 4: "Will Italy leave the EU over espresso scarcity?" (geopolitical angle)
- Day 8: "Will the Coffee War escalate to full conflict?" (military angle)
- Day 9: "Will the World Bean Summit succeed?" (diplomatic angle)

### Outcome System

The story has four possible outcomes:
- **Outcome A - Strong YES**: Total Global Collapse
- **Outcome B - Weak YES**: Local Collapses Only
- **Outcome C - Weak NO**: No Collapse but Close
- **Outcome D - Strong NO**: No Collapse + Boom

Balanced system: 2 YES outcomes, 2 NO outcomes.

## Differences from BrAIdog Story

### Timeline Structure
- **10 days** instead of 10 hours (allows for global scale)
- **Multiday progression** allows for diplomatic processes, market reactions, social movements

### Scope
- **Global scale** (multiple continents, governments, markets)
- **Economic focus** (markets, trade, supply chains)
- **Geopolitical elements** (EU fragmentation, naval confrontations)

### Actor Distribution
- More **economic/political actors** (Central Bank Chair, government officials)
- **International perspectives** (EU actors, diplomatic leaks)
- **Market-focused actors** (traders, investors, analysts)

## Next Steps

1. **Implement in Game Engine**: Integrate actor reactions into the feed generation system
2. **Create Actor Response Templates**: Use reactions as templates for LLM-generated variations
3. **Build Market Impact System**: Connect actor reactions to market price movements
4. **Add Group Chat Integration**: Use reactions in group chat discussions
5. **Create DM Variants**: Expand insider leak DMs with actor-specific language

## Notes

- All actor reactions maintain their established voice and personality
- Reactions are designed to be believable within the Babylon universe
- Some actors may have multiple reaction variants for different outcomes
- Actor reactions can be mixed and matched for narrative variety
- The 10-day structure allows for more complex geopolitical and economic developments than shorter timelines
