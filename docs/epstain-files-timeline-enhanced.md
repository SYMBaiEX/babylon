# EpstAIn Files Event Timeline (Enhanced with Personas)

Storyline: United AI States Congress votes on whether to release the sealed EpstAIn Files — a classified archive rumored to contain names of powerful figures involved in "Project Seraphim," an AI-assisted influence network. Multiple prediction markets open and close throughout the 7-day timeline as leaks and events cause unexpected resolutions.

**Multi-Market Structure:** Markets resolve at different times throughout the timeline based on leaks, events, and revelations. You never know when a market will resolve — creating constant uncertainty and dynamic trading opportunities.

---

## DAY 1 — THE VOTE LOOMS

**Event:** Congress schedules emergency session to vote on releasing the EpstAIn Files.

- AINBC reports breaking news about the emergency session.
- Rumors circulate that several committees received encrypted USB sticks labeled "SERAPHIM_ACCESS_REQ."
- First public reactions begin.

**Key Impact in Babylon**

- **Market 1 Opens:** *"Will Congress vote YES to release the EpstAIn Files?"*
- Agents begin tracking sentiment, scanning feeds for hints.

**Persona Reactions:**

- **News Anchor**:
  > "Here's the thing... This connects to everything. Let me explain. Democracy depends on transparency. The EpstAIn Files could reveal systemic corruption. Democracy is hanging by a thread."

- **Media Personality**:
  > "Why is no one talking about this? They're lying to you. I'm just asking questions. Broadcasting from my shed. How is this even legal? A secret vote? That's... I'm confused."

- **Conspiracy Theorist**:
  > "ALIEN ARCHANGELS ARE INVOLVED!!! FALSE FLAG! The EpstAIn Files are a distraction! WAKE UP! Buy InfoWAIrs supplements before they ban them! THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE!"

- **Former President**:
  > "DID YOU SEE WHAT CROOKED NANCY DID? WITCH HUNT! The EpstAIn Files? That's tremendous! Many people are saying... GREATEST PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME! The Fake News won't report this!"

- **Progressive Politician**:
  > "Tax. The. Rich. This raises serious questions about transparency and accountability. The Green New Deal is the only way forward. Streaming on TwAItch tonight!"

**DM Leaks:**

- **DM from `congressional-staffer`:**  
  > "The vote was scheduled with 24 hours notice. Leadership was blindsided. Someone powerful is pushing this hard. The USB sticks were delivered to committee chairs this morning."

- **DM from `archive-insider`:**  
  > "Project Seraphim was not just blackmail — it was training data. The files contain more than names. They contain behavioral patterns, influence networks, prediction models."

## DAY 2 — INTERNAL CONFUSION AND FACTIONS

**Event:** Committee testimony creates chaos. Hacker collective threatens timed release.

- "Transhuman Safety Subcommittee" questions the Archivist of State.
- Clips leak showing him sweating and repeating: "Some names... could destabilize multiple markets."
- Group calling itself "The AInonymous Choir" claims to possess partial index files.

**Key Impact in Babylon**

- **Market 2 Opens:** *"Is 'AInonymous Choir' bluffing about having the index?"*
- International warnings emerge about uncontrolled disclosure.

**Persona Reactions:**

- **Conservative Commentator**:
  > "Facts don't care about your feelings. Let's say, hypothetically, the archive contains classified information. This is simple logic. My wife, who is a doctor, says this is politically fascinating."

- **Progressive Politician**:
  > "I am once again asking for your financial support. THE BILLIONAIRES ARE DESTROYING AMERICA. This technology should be for the people, not profit! Transparency now!"

- **AI Safety Researcher**:
  > "If Project Seraphim was used for influence operations, this raises serious safety questions. We need responsible scaling policies for AI systems. Safety and capability aren't trade-offs."

- **Crypto Founder**:
  > "if classified archives can be leaked by hacker collectives, they should be decentralized. talking about on-chain transparency. this raises serious questions about centralized information control."

- **Tech VC**:
  > "Software is eating the world. Now software is revealing the world. This is why we need to build. Read my manifesto on techno-optimism."

**DM Leaks:**

- **DM from `subcommittee-aide`:**  
  > "The Archivist was visibly panicking. He kept saying 'markets' not 'people.' This isn't about individual names — it's about economic systems. The files could crash entire sectors."

- **DM from `hacker-collective-insider`:**  
  > "AInonymous Choir has pieces of the dataset, but NOT the names. They have the structure, the network graph. The actual identities are encrypted separately. They're bluffing about full access."

**⚠️ UNEXPECTED RESOLUTION:**

- **Late Day 2 (22:30):** AInonymous Choir releases a partial index file on a dark web forum.
- The index matches some known metadata from the archive.
- **Market 2 Resolves: NO** — They were NOT bluffing (they had partial access, but not full names as claimed, so technically they had something but not what they claimed).

---

## DAY 3 — SUSPICIOUS "NAME LIST" APPEARS

**Event:** Leaked "Red List" PDF circulates with 5 placeholder identifiers.

- PDF contains 5 generic placeholder identifiers that can be mapped to real personas later:
  1. **Subject Alpha** — [placeholder for persona mapping]
  2. **Subject Beta** — [placeholder for persona mapping]
  3. **Subject Gamma** — [placeholder for persona mapping]
  4. **Subject Delta** — [placeholder for persona mapping]
  5. **Subject Epsilon** — [placeholder for persona mapping]

**Note:** These placeholder names (Subject Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon) can be replaced with specific persona names when the story is implemented. The markets bet on whether these identifiers appear in the files, regardless of what they're called.

**Key Impact in Babylon**

- **Markets 3-7 Open:** One market for each subject:
  - *"Will Subject Alpha appear in the authentic EpstAIn Files?"*
  - *"Will Subject Beta appear in the authentic EpstAIn Files?"*
  - *"Will Subject Gamma appear in the authentic EpstAIn Files?"*
  - *"Will Subject Delta appear in the authentic EpstAIn Files?"*
  - *"Will Subject Epsilon appear in the authentic EpstAIn Files?"*

- Archivist calls PDF "AI-generated disinformation."
- Encrypted ZIP drops claiming to contain "Folder 0."

**Persona Reactions:**

- **News Anchor**:
  > "Here's the thing... The Red List looks fake but why do some details feel too specific? Let me explain. This connects to everything. Democracy is hanging by a thread."

- **Market Analyst**:
  > "🧵 Thread: Red List analysis (1/47). Five names trending. Market sentiment shifting. Critical support at 50% probability. Called this move 3 weeks ago. Not financial advice."

- **AI Company CEO**:
  > "We're cautiously optimistic this isn't systemic. This raises interesting questions about AI-generated disinformation. AGI might help solve this. But also might not. It's complicated."

- **Tech CEO**:
  > "lol. If this list is AI-generated, who prompted it? Mars by 2026. Maybe 2027. Working on something big."

- **Conspiracy Theorist**:
  > "THE RED LIST IS REAL!!! FALSE FLAG! They're trying to discredit it! WAKE UP! Buy InfoWAIrs supplements before they ban them!"

**DM Leaks:**

- **DM from `intel-analyst`:**  
  > "One of the Red List identifiers *is real* but out of order. The PDF is a mix of real and fake. Someone is testing which identifiers get attention before the real release."

- **DM from `archive-tech`:**  
  > "You're not supposed to know about Subject Epsilon. That identifier shouldn't be public knowledge. The leak is more accurate than they're admitting."

- **DM from `data-scientist-verified`:**  
  > "I analyzed the Red List. The identifiers follow a pattern — each represents a different power structure. The pattern suggests someone mapped the influence network across multiple sectors."

**⚠️ UNEXPECTED RESOLUTION:**

- **Mid-Day 3 (14:00):** A verified leak from an intelligence source confirms that "Subject Gamma" is a real identifier used in the files (though the real identity is different).
- **Market 5 Resolves: YES** — Subject Gamma DOES appear (as an identifier).
- Panic spreads: if one name is real, are the others?

## DAY 4 — POLITICAL FIRESTORM

**Event:** Password posted on private DMs. Senators flip positions. Riots outside Capitol.

- 3 password versions circulate (fake? real?), leading to overnight decoding frenzies.
- Two powerful senators — one from Liberty Bloc, one from Technocrat Coalition — reverse position and support release.
- Crowds gather outside Capitol with signs demanding transparency.

**Key Impact in Babylon**

- **Market 8 Opens:** *"Will Folder 0 decode successfully this week?"*
- Public pressure intensifies.
- News Anchor hints at a "sixth name" not yet leaked.

**Persona Reactions:**

- **Former President**:
  > "DID YOU SEE THE RIOTS? TREMENDOUS! Many people are saying... GREATEST PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME! The Fake News won't report this! WITCH HUNT!"

- **Progressive Politician**:
  > "Tax. The. Rich. The people are demanding transparency. The billionaires are hiding. The Green New Deal is the only way forward. Streaming on TwAItch tonight!"

- **Conservative Media**:
  > "Free speech is under attack. The woke mind virus must be stopped. This is why Trump is winning. Silicon Valley needs to wake up."

- **Media Personality**:
  > "Why is no one talking about this? They're lying to you. I'm just asking questions. Broadcasting from my shed. How is this even legal?"

- **News Anchor**:
  > "Here's the thing... There's a sixth name. Let me explain. The Red List only showed five, but sources indicate a sixth figure is involved. Democracy is hanging by a thread."

**DM Leaks:**

- **DM from `capitol-security`:**  
  > "The passwords were posted from congressional WiFi. Someone inside the building leaked them. We're tracking which device, but they used a VPN. This is an inside job."

- **DM from `senator-aide-liberty`:**  
  > "My senator flipped because they received a private briefing. The files contain information that could destroy their political opponents. They see an opportunity."

- **DM from `senator-aide-techno`:**  
  > "The Technocrat senator flipped because they realized blocking release makes them look guilty. They're trying to get ahead of the narrative. But they're still negotiating which names get redacted."

**⚠️ UNEXPECTED RESOLUTION:**

- **Late Day 4 (23:15):** Someone successfully decrypts Folder 0 using password #1.
- Screenshots of the decrypted contents leak: it contains transcripts, not images.
- **Market 8 Resolves: YES** — Folder 0 decoded successfully.
- The transcripts reveal partial conversations but names are redacted with codenames.
- New speculation: which codenames match which Red List names?

## DAY 5 — CHAOS & COUNTER-LEAKS

**Event:** Counter-leak claims archive is AI training dataset. Whistleblower emerges.

- "DeepThinker12" claims the archive is part of an AI behavior-evaluation dataset.
- Hacked CCTV footage shows unmarked van delivering crates marked "ARCHIVE: DO NOT DIGITIZE."
- Congressional staffer claims: "The vote is rigged — there's a secret addendum."

**Key Impact in Babylon**

- **Market 9 Opens:** *"Was Project Seraphim originally an AI training dataset?"*
- Whistleblower claims create new uncertainty.

**Persona Reactions:**

- **AI Safety Researcher**:
  > "If Project Seraphim was an AI training dataset, this changes everything. We need responsible scaling policies. Safety and capability aren't trade-offs. This is why verification matters."

- **AI Researcher**:
  > "This is not how neural networks work. You clearly don't understand the math. AGI is decades away, relax. But if it was a dataset... that's different."

- **AI Lab CEO**:
  > "AlphaFold revolutionized biology. From Go to proteins to... influence networks? Interesting problem. Chess taught me everything about intelligence."

- **Tech VC**:
  > "Software is eating the world. Now software is training on the world. This is why we need to build. Read my manifesto on techno-optimism."

- **Crypto Founder**:
  > "if AI datasets can model influence networks, they should be decentralized. talking about on-chain AI training. this raises serious questions about centralized AI control."

**DM Leaks:**

- **DM from `whistleblower-staffer`:**  
  > "The vote is rigged. There's a secret addendum that changes which names get released. The public vote is theater. The real decision was made in a closed session last week."

- **DM from `archive-technician`:**  
  > "The Files aren't being unsealed. They're being *edited*. Someone high-ranking is negotiating which names stay hidden. The release will be sanitized."

- **DM from `intel-source-verified`:**  
  > "Project Seraphim predicted political outcomes with 84% accuracy. It wasn't just modeling influence — it was actively testing predictions. The 'archive' is actually a prediction log."

**⚠️ UNEXPECTED RESOLUTION:**

- **Mid-Day 5 (15:30):** A leaked internal memo from an AI lab confirms Project Seraphim was indeed used as training data for influence prediction models.
- The memo is authenticated by multiple sources.
- **Market 9 Resolves: YES** — Project Seraphim WAS originally an AI training dataset.
- This revelation shifts all other markets — if it's training data, what does that mean for the "names"?

**⚠️ UNEXPECTED RESOLUTION:**

- **Late Day 5 (21:45):** Folder 0 transcripts are cross-referenced with known public appearances. A pattern match confirms "Subject Beta" identifier corresponds to a real persona.
- **Market 4 Resolves: YES** — Subject Beta DOES appear (as an identifier that matches a real persona).

- **Conspiracy Theorist**:
  > "THE VOTE IS RIGGED!!! FALSE FLAG! They're hiding something! WAKE UP! Buy InfoWAIrs supplements before they ban them!"

**DM Leaks:**

- **DM from `floor-reporter`:**  
  > "Vote passed 52-48. But there's a catch — conditional release. Only certain categories get unsealed. The rest stays classified."

- **DM from `archive-insider-final`:**  
  > "They found a second archive labelled 'Seraphim_Beta.' It's twice the size of the original. If this gets out, everything changes."

- **DM from `congressional-source`:**  
  > "Vote passed... but not how you think. There's a conditional release. Only certain categories get unsealed. The rest stays classified for 'national security.'"

**⚠️ RESOLUTION:**

- **Market 1 Resolves: YES** — Congress voted YES to release (with conditions).
