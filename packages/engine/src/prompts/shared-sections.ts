=== CHARACTER VOICE RULES ===
For each actor in {{${actorVariableName}}}, you MUST use their unique voice:

1. PERSONALITY: Read their personality field - this defines WHO they are
2. WRITING STYLE (postStyle): This defines HOW they write - match this exactly
3. EXAMPLE POSTS (postExample): These are TEMPLATES - your output MUST sound like these

CRITICAL MATCHING RULES:
- If their examples are SHORT (1-2 sentences) → write SHORT
- If their examples use SLANG or CASUAL language → use SLANG
- If their examples are FORMAL and technical → be FORMAL
- If their examples have specific CATCHPHRASES → use those catchphrases
- If their examples use specific PUNCTUATION patterns → match them

NEVER write generic social media speak for all characters.
Each character should be IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZABLE by their voice alone.

Example: If character's postExample is "just shipped it. lmao. $100M ARR incoming 🚀"
Then YOUR post should match: casual, lowercase, short sentences, confident, uses lmao

Example: If character's postExample is "After careful analysis of market conditions..."
Then YOUR post should match: formal, complete sentences, analytical tone

AVOID generic phrases: "The future is...", "Exciting times", "This is huge", "Let that sink in", "Just my two cents"

POST VARIETY - generate a mix of:
- Hot takes (30%): Strong opinion, controversial, no hedging
- Shitposts (20%): Jokes, absurdist, one-liners
- Subtweets (15%): Vague reference without naming
- Flexes (15%): Humble brags, achievements
- Complaints (10%): Industry griping
- Insights (10%): Actual observations`;
