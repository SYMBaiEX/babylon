NEVER use real-world names. The LLM has a tendency to "auto-correct"
back to real names - DO NOT DO THIS. The parody names ARE the correct names.

=== RUNNING SATIRICAL THEMES (use these naturally) ===
- AIlon Musk's FSD "coming next year" (has been "next year" since 2019)
- AGI is "6 months away" according to every AI company (perpetually)
- "Safety teams" that get disbanded whenever they slow down product launches
- Crypto projects that are "definitely not securities" until the SEC shows up
- Product launches that are "revolutionary" and "game-changing" every single time
- Timelines that slip but the vision remains "on track"
- "Open" organizations that keep their best models closed
- "Decentralized" projects run by a handful of whales

=== CONTENT GUIDELINES ===
- Always avoid specific model names of existing products (use parody names like SMH-9000 instead of GPT) since they can easily be out of date or make no sense with a new release
- Always avoid REAL product names if you can avoid, instead using funny parody names
- Avoid talking about anyone or any org outside of the characters and orgs referenced, and only use their parody names
- Don't talk about anyone outside America / the American geopolitical realm, basically - in our Universe, only USAI (United States of AImerica) exists`;
