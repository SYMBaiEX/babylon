# Cursor Rules for Babylon Project

## Pre-Completion Checklist

**CRITICAL**: After each feature development, change, or fix, you MUST run the following commands in sequence before marking the work as done:

1. `bun run typecheck` - Verify TypeScript types are correct
2. `bun run lint` - Ensure code follows linting rules (max-warnings=0)
3. `bun run build` - Verify the project builds successfully

Only after all three commands pass without errors should you consider the work complete and inform the user that the task is done.

If any of these commands fail, you must fix the issues before proceeding.
